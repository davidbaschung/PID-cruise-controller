> PID and 'bang-bang' speed controllers for vehicles

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing mathematical functions as a discrete data-set and real-time mapping, i.e. taking speed records, calculate error margin with the objective and compute an acceleration pulse, based on error coefficient, its derivative and previous errors integration.</li>
  <li>Observer pattern implementation</li>
</ul>
